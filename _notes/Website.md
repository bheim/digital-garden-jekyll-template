#### Welcome
I'm Ben - a builder based out of Chicago currently finishing up my undergrad @UChicago.

I call myself a builder because I have an incessant need to build things I think will help people when I have downtime. This tendency has led me down many paths, but I'm currently a energy drink that provides all-day focused energy - [[Peak]].
